# Motion Tracker Beta
An easy-to-use, standalone and open-source motion tracking application for researchers and engineers, written in Python.

## Features
- Intutitive graphical user interface
- Capable of handling the most common video formats
- Capable of tracking various properties of multiple objects simultaneously
- Diverse set of built in tracking algorithms, based on the `OpenCV` libary
- Rich selection of numerical differentiation algorithms powered by the `PyNumDiff` libary
- Built in plotting an exporting features


For the complete list of features please check the [documentation](https://github.com/flochkristof/motiontracker/blob/main/docs/GUIDE.pdf).

## Dependencies
The Graphical user interface was created with the [PyQt5](https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/) framework. For the handling of video files and to do the actual tracking the [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) library was used with its built in tracking algorithms. Numerical differentiations are carried out using the [PyNumDiff](https://github.com/florisvb/PyNumDiff). Plots and figures are generated by [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/). For the complete list of required packages check [pyproject.toml](https://github.com/flochkristof/motiontracker/blob/main/pyproject.toml) [requirements.txt](https://github.com/flochkristof/motiontracker/blob/main/requirements.txt)
